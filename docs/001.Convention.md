Convention
==========

# Convention on directories

By default, it is expected that the modules will be located in the catalog 
`/module` of the root directory your project.

It is also possible to place modules in the catalog `/vendor` of the root
directory your project.

# Convention on the requirements for the module

- The module should have its own namespace.
- At least, the module must contain a `Module` class.
- The file of `Module` class must be located in the root directory of the module.
- The file of module class must be called as `Module.php`.
- For compatibility with PSR-4 loaders, is needed additional file with following
  contents:
```
<?php

require_once dirname(__DIR__) . DIRECTORY_SEPARATOR . 'Module.php';
```
This file must be located in the directory with source code of module and also 
to be named as `Module.php`.
```
project/
    module/
        ExampleModule/
            Module.php // The class of module
            src/
                Module.php // The PSR-4 stub
                ...
    vendor/
    ...
```
# Convention on `Module` class

- The `Module` class must be located in root of module namespace.
- The `Module` class must extends `Es\Modules\AbstractModule`.
```
namespace ExampleModule;

use Es\Modules\AbstractModule;

class Module extends AbstractModule
{
}
```
